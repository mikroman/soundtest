BBC Micro background music player

This is a background music player for the [BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro). The included melody is 3 channels and is played back in the background using a vertical sync (VBLANK) event handler. The code is mostly derived from the game [REPTON](http://www.bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=266) with some modifcations to simplify.
